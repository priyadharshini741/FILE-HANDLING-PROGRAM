This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in the C programming language, including how to create, write, read, and append text files. It is designed for beginners who want to understand how file streams work in C and how to handle errors gracefully. The code is simple, well-commented, and easy to run on any standard C compiler. Feel free to use, modify, or expand this program to learn more about file I/O in C. I have done this program in visualstudio code and i gained knowledge from online videos like youtube channel programmiz.
